# The unstable branch

## What is it
This branch is where changes go before they are thoroughly tested for bugs, and or finished. This branch contains the latest in developement features. This means it they may not mesh up perfectly with stable developements. If you wish to use this branch of the software make sure both the client and the server are using this branch of developement. Also note that the usage may not be entirely smooth if a feature is half finished, for example a button or option might not do anything, you are able to use some features in an updated way but others may not yet be updated.

## Pros and cons
| Pros | Cons |
| :------------- | :----------: |
|  Latest Features before release | Features may not work well |
| Get to test new features | Not everything works |
| Give feedback on potential updates | May not work with the main branch of software |

## Beta testing
If you wish to do tests on potential features simply download or clone this branch, test any new features, then create an issue to give feedback and report bugs. you can also attempt to fix bugs yourself and then create a pull request and I'll review the code and possibly add it.
